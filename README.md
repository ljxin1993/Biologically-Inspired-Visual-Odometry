This software is for the demonstration of biologically inspired visual odometry based on the computational model of grid cells, which is developed based on the the source code of the computational model of grid cells: http://clm.utexas.edu/fietelab/code.htm, and LIBVISO2: http://www.cvlibs.net/software/libviso/.


We would like to thank Y. Burak and I. R. Fiete for their release of the source code about continuous attractor network model of grid cells, Andreas Geiger for his release of LIBVISO2.
